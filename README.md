Farms trees for logs. These logs can be turned into charcoal then put back into turtles. I set this up on a server so everyone could have infinite fuel for their turtles. Makes writing code a lot more fun. I tested using birch trees, but ended up using spruce because they are generally taller and have more leaves, making the bot more efficient. Oak cannot be used because of the [Fancy oak](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Oak#:~:text=Fancy%20oaks%20are,on%20all%20sides.)

## Farm

Farms wheat. Try to keep the width of the farm an even number to keep efficiency up. 10 by 13 was large enough for the 5 people on my server to never worry about food again. After a day and a half (Real human time) we had a full double chest of bread.

## Cobblestone Generator

THIS THING IS EXTREMELY LOUD!!!!<br/>
Will produce cobblestone faster than you can use it. At one point I had 2 turtles building, and I was building myself. Only then was I able to make a dent in the double chest that this thing feeds into

## General

- There are lots of helper functions in the files. Some work, some don't, some will behave in a way that you won't expect. Use at own risk.
- The most updated functions are in the cobblestone generator file. As far as I am aware, they all work. The ones that don't work are in other files.
- For all of the code here, if there is a block in the way, it will be broken. The turtle will not go around. This means that turtles will break each other if their paths intersect.
